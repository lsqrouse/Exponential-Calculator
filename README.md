# Exponential-Calculator
This is a small program that I started writing while I was working on my Calculus 1 homework on Exponential growth. While working on the homework, I realzied that it could be done very easily using recursion, so I decided to write a program to do just that. After the intial program, I thought it would be fun to add a few more features and a GUI to make it a bit more friendly and get me more experience working with GUIs.
